# Overview
We applied a uniform framework for scoring U2 snRNP residency at the 3' end of all introns using ENCODE eCLIP data (https://www.encodeproject.org/) performed in HepG2 cell line, facilitating the understanding of U2 snRNP binding patterns across introns. This repository specifically includes details and links to processed files related to our manuscript:
